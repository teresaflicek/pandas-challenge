## Project Introduction - Heroes of Pymoli

I've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for the fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. The purpose of this report is to break down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.

## Data Summary

The CSV file provides purchasing information about the optional items offered in the game. The dataset includes the Purchase ID for each transaction, player information (Screen Name, Age, and Gender) and item information (Item ID, Item Name, and Price). 

## Gender Demographics

The Gender Purchasing Analysis displays the number of purchases, the average purchase price, the total purchase value, and the average total purchase per person - all by gender categories of (male, female, and other/non-disclosed). 

## Age Demographics

The Age Purchasing Analysis displays the purchase count of items, the average purchase price, the total purchase value, and the average total purchase per person - all by age group of players (grouped every 4 years, i.e. <10, 10-14, 15-19, etc.).

## Top Spenders

The top spenders analysis displays the top 5 spenders on optional items. This includes how many transactions they've had, the average purchase price of the items and the total purchase value of all their transactions. The top spender has the most transactions in the data set.

## Most Popular and Profitable Items

The most popular items in this dataset are determined by the number of times they've been purchased.

The most profitable items in this dataset are determined by the total purchase value.

## Observable Trends

Three observable trends based on the data include:

1. From the Gender Purchasing Analysis we can conclude that male players make up a majority of the revenue from optional item purchases which statistically makes sense as the percentage of male players is 84% of total players.

2. From the Age Purchasing Analysis we can conclude that 20-24 year olds make the most purchases out of any age group which correlates to the majority of players falling into the 20-24 year old age group - 45% of total players.

3. The most popular optional item purchased in the game is the 'Final Critic', purchased a total of 13 times and priced at $4.61.
